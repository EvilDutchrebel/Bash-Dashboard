# Bash-Dashboard
<h1>A productivity Dashboard written in Bash to run in terminal</h1>

<p>As one of my IT projects while I'm getting my degree for Expert IT Systems and Devices, I wanted to make my life easier.
This project gives me a good understanding how to automate my appointments and my To-Do's, also refered as tasks here.
As someone with ADD, I really need some grip in my life and while using a lot of reccomended apps and tools, it never really worked for me, either it makes me lazy or I need 3 different apps to get the same thing done that I can do here. I needed a program to give me the information as raw as possible without any bells and whistles, and no distracting notifications.

From here out I'm goint to future build this project to make my life easier and simpler. Maybe it can help you too!</p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

There are two files combined with Dashboard.sh
<li>
  <ul>appointmentslist.sh</ul>
  <ul>tasklist.sh</ul>
</li>
<p> Right now you still have to load up seperately the two programs to add appointments and tasklists. /n
there are two txt files that will store your appointments and tasks. /n
Next up is a weather function where you have to change your lengtitude/longtitude for accurate weather other than my location. (did I just doxx myself? :O, nah it's in a completely different part of town.) /n
for future proofing there is also the next couple of functions to add later or ignore.</p>
<li>
  <ul>Goals</ul>
  <ul>Habits</ul>
  <ul>Notes</ul>
  <ul>Qoutes</ul>
</li>

<h3>Colors</h3>
<p>Personally I love a cyber feel to my programs, feel free to change that to whatever colors you like! Go crazy! Ok, a bit more normal, CRAZY AGAIN!</p>

<h3>Changelog 02-07-2024:</h3>
  * Changed the appointmentslist, it would save non chronologically and now it does!
  * Changed how many tasks there are shown, I got too many tasks which made it clutter, now it shows 3 tasks max and then it says +(i) more tasks
